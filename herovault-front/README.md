# Herovault client

This is the client side of the Herovault project. It is an Angular application that allows users to create, edit, and delete characters for tabletop roleplaying games, mostly conforming to DnD characters. The application is designed to be used in conjunction with the Herovault API, which is a GraphQL API that provides the backend functionality for the application.
